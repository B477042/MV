### Server
To run the game server, You have to install the Node.js for Windows. After that, you need to execute the following shell code.

```shell
npm init
npm install
```

This is not using the database. But The Database will be updating later.

### Client
This plugin provides the Basic Framework that can send a message and can receive the message, via a library called Node.js and Socket.io. But I am thinking that my code is a mess.
