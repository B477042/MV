I will redesign the server and client from the ground up.
Of course, To do all these improvements, I'll need a lot of time.

# Goals

<BR>Many good games are saving an ID and hashed password to DB.
- Manage an user schema using Mongoose
- Adding an Encryption feature
- Modularization all of features
